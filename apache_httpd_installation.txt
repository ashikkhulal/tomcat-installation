Install and Configure an HTTP Server (Apache):

Install the Apache Web Server:

    Install the Apache web server, default package from the configured repositories, like so:
        $ sudo yum install -y httpd

Remove the Default Symlink Configuration from the Server:
    You will need to edit the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file and find the following line:
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    and remove the symlinks option so it reads simply
        Options Indexes
    Also, edit following lines:
        AllowOverride None
    to
        AllowOverride Options

Start httpd service:
    $ sudo systemctl start httpd
    $ sudo systemctl enable httpd

Create a new Index File in the Default Web Server Directory:
    Our default web server directory is in /var/www/html, so in there, create a file called 'index.html' containing some text that you can test and clearly identify from your client server.
    To verify, run following command:
        $ curl localhost
        And it should print what you put in index.html file.
    
On the client, to install a text based webbrower:

    Install elinks:
        $ sudo yum install elinks -y
    verify by running following command:
        $ elinks
        And enter http://(your-private-ip)/index.html to open the text-based browser.

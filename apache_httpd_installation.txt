Install and Configure an HTTP Server (Apache):

Install the Apache Web Server:

    Install the Apache web server, default package from the configured repositories, like so:
        $ sudo yum install -y httpd

Remove the Default Symlink Configuration from the Server:
    You will need to edit the /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file and find the following line:
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    and remove the symlinks option so it reads simply
        Options Indexes 

Create a new Index File in the Default Web Server Directory:
    Our default web server directory is in /var/www/html, so in there, create a file called 'index.html' containing some text that you can test and clearly identify from your client server.
